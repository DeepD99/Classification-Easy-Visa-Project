# EasyVisa - Visa Approval Prediction Project

## üíº Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a visa application will be **approved or denied**, based on a variety of features related to the employer, employee, and job role. The model aims to help streamline the decision-making process for visa officers and increase transparency in the application pipeline.

## üß† Objectives

- Understand the key factors that influence visa approval.
- Preprocess and clean real-world visa application data.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract insights.
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Select the best-performing model for deployment.

| `full_time_position`     | Indicates if the position is full-time (`Yes` or `No`)                   |
| `job_experience`         | Number of years of relevant job experience                               |
| `state`                  | U.S. state where the job is located                                      |
| `country_of_citizenship` | Country of the applicant‚Äôs citizenship                                   |
| `application_year`       | Year in which the visa application was filed                             |
| `job_category`           | Industry or field of the job (e.g., Tech, Finance, Healthcare)           |
| `sponsorship_required`   | Whether visa sponsorship was required for the role (`Yes` or `No`)       |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The final model was able to successfully predict visa approval with strong performance metrics. The most significant factors influencing the prediction included job role, education level, full-time status, and salary.

This model can help in pre-screening visa applications and flagging high-risk profiles for further review.
