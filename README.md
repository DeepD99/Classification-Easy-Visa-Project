# EasyVisa - Visa Approval Prediction Project

## üíº Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a visa application will be **approved or denied**, based on a variety of features related to the employer, employee, and job role. The model aims to help streamline the decision-making process for visa officers and increase transparency in the application pipeline.

---

## üß† Objectives

- Understand the key factors that influence visa approval.
- Preprocess and clean real-world visa application data.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract insights.
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Select the best-performing model for deployment.

---

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes features such as:

- `case_status` (target): 1 for Approved, 0 for Denied  
- `employer_name`: Name of the employer  
- `job_title`: Title of the job role  
- `education_level`, `salary`, `full_time_position`  
- `state`, `country_of_citizenship`, etc.

*Note: You can find the dataset used in the project root.*

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The final model was able to successfully predict visa approval with strong performance metrics. The most significant factors influencing the prediction included job role, education level, full-time status, and salary.

This model can help in pre-screening visa applications and flagging high-risk profiles for further review.
